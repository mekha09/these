The ability to initiate and observe such electronic dynamics in polyatomic molecules represents a crucial step forward in attosecond science, which is progressively moving toward the investigation of more and more complex systems.},

Of interest is that the rotational Doppler shift directly reflects the rotational symmetry of q-plates and can be also expressed as \&\#x394;\&\#x3C9; $=$ $\Omega$n , where n $=$ 2(q-1) denotes the fold number of rotational symmetry. Besides, based on this single-photon spin-orbit-RDS entanglement, we propose an experimental scheme to sort photons of different frequency shifts according to individual orbital angular momentum.},

  Abstract                 = {This tutorial presents an introduction to the interaction of light and matter on the attosecond timescale. Our aim is to detail the theoretical description of ultra-short time delays and to relate these to the phase of extreme ultraviolet (XUV) light pulses and to the asymptotic phaseshifts of photoelectron wave packets. Special emphasis is laid on time-delay experiments, where attosecond XUV pulses are used to photoionize target atoms at well-defined times, followed by a probing process in real time by a phase-locked, infrared laser field. In this way, the laser field serves as a â€˜clockâ€™ to monitor the ionization event, but the observable delays do not correspond directly to the delay associated with single-photon ionization. Instead, a significant part of the observed delay originates from a measurement induced process, which obscures the single-photon ionization dynamics. This artefact is traced back to a phaseshift of the above-threshold ionization transition matrix element, which we call the continuumâ€“continuum phase . It arises due to the laser-stimulated transitions between Coulomb continuum states. As we shall show here, these measurement-induced effects can be separated from the single-photon ionization process, using analytical expressions of universal character, so that eventually the attosecond time delays in photoionization can be accessed.},

  Abstract                 = {Some 16 years ago, Allen et al. [Phys. Rev. A 45, 8185 (1992)] recognised that laser beams which carried an angular momentum additional to photon spin, could be realized in the laboratory. Such beams have helical phase fronts and so have an azimuthal component to the Poynting vector, which results in angular momentum along the beam axis. This orbital angular momentum, very often combined with spin to make optical angular momentum, has given rise to many developments. These range from optical spanners for driving micro-machines to high dimensional quantum entanglement and new opportunities in quantum information processing. The concept of orbital angular momentum is now leading to new understanding of a wide range of phenomena, including fundamental processes in Bose-Einstein condensates, while the associated technologies have led to new applications in optical tweezing and microscopy.},

  Abstract                 = {Recent evidence has shown that d-amino acids are present in animals and humans in high concentrations and fulfill specific biological functions. In the central nervous system, two d-amino acids, d-serine and d-aspartate, occur in considerable concentrations. d-Serine is synthesized and metabolized endogenously and the same might account for d-aspartate. d-Serine has been studied most extensively and was shown to play a role in excitatory amino acid metabolism, being a co-agonist of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Insight into d-serine metabolism is relevant for physiological \{NMDA\} receptor (NMDAr) activation and for all the disorders associated with an altered function of the NMDAr, such as schizophrenia, ischemia, epilepsy, and neurodegenerative disorders. d-Aspartate appears to play a role in development and endocrine function, but the precise function of d-aspartate and other d-amino acids in animals and humans requires further investigation. As d-amino acids play biological roles, alterations in the concentrations of d-amino acids might occur in some disorders and relate to the pathogenesis of these disorders. d-Amino acid concentrations may then not only help in the diagnostic process, but also provide novel therapeutic targets. Consequently, the presence and important roles of d-amino acids in higher organisms do not only challenge former theories on mammalian physiology, but also contribute to exciting new insights in human disease. },

  Abstract                 = {We present a surprising modification of optical interferometry. A so-called spiral phase element in the beam path of a standard microscope results in an interferogram of phase samples, for which the interference fringes have the shape of spirals instead of closed contour lines as in traditional interferograms. This configuration overrides the basic problem of interferometry, i.e., that elevations and depressions cannot be distinguished. Therefore a complete sample profile can be reconstructed from a single exposure, promising, e.g., high-speed metrology with a single laser pulse. The method is easy to implement, it does not require a spatially separated reference beam, and it is optimally stable against environmental noise.},

  Abstract                 = {Photoionization of the chiral molecule glycidol has been investigated in the valence region. Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) curves have been obtained at various photon energies by using circularly polarized VUV synchrotron radiation and a velocity map imaging technique to record angle-resolved photoelectron spectra (PES). The measured chiral asymmetries vary dramatically with the photon energy as well as with the ionized orbital{,} improving the effective orbital resolution of the PECD spectrum with respect to the PES. Typical asymmetry factors of 5% are observed{,} but the peak values measured range up to 15%. The experimental results are interpreted by continuum multiple scattering (CMS-X[small alpha]) calculations for several thermally accessible glycidol conformers. We find that a nearly quantitative agreement between theory and experiments can be achieved for the ionization of several molecular orbitals. Owing to the sensitivity of PECD to molecular conformation this allows us to identify the dominant conformer. The influence of intramolecular hydrogen bond orbital polarization is found to play a small yet significant role in determining the chiral asymmetry in the electron angular distributions.},

The orbital contribution is due to an azimuthal phase variation that arises in the nonlinear current density. This phase variation is associated with the radial nonuniformity driven by ponderomotive blowout.},

Since the method preserves the discrete form of the Parseval theorem, it is particularly suitable for field propagation.

The advantages and the disadvantages of the method with respect to other typical methods are discussed.},

Both temporal and spatial information on this wavepacket can be obtained through the coherent soft X-ray emission resulting from the laser-driven recollision of the liberated electron with the core. By characterizing the emission from aligned N2 molecules, we demonstrate the attosecond contributions of the two highest occupied molecular orbitals. We determine conditions where they are disentangled in the real and imaginary parts of the emission dipole moment. This allows us to carry out a tomographic reconstruction of both orbitals with angstrom spatial resolution. Their coherent superposition provides experimental images of the attosecond wavepacket created in the ionization process. Our results open the prospect of imaging ultrafast intramolecular dynamics combining attosecond and angstrom resolutions.},

We explore the details of the mapping of the driving vortex to its harmonic spectrum. In particular we show that the geometry of the harmonic vortices is complex, arising from the superposition of the contribution from the short and long quantum paths responsible of HHG. Transversal phase-matching and quantum path interferences provide an explanation of the dramatic changes in the XUV vortex structure generated at different relative positions of the target respect to the laser beam focus. Finally, we show how to take advantage of transversal phase-matching to select helical attosecond beams generated from short or long quantum paths, exhibiting positive or negative temporal chirp respectively.},

In particular, p-subshell ionization is analysed and compared with s-subshell ionization. Simple analytical expressions for the CD are obtained for both s- and p-subshell ionization. The calculations performed for Ne(2p) ionization by an extreme ultraviolet pulse in the presence of an infrared laser pulse show that the CD in this case is appreciably larger than in previously discussed s-shell ionization. It makes this case favourable for applications as a sensitive tool for measuring the helicity of short-wavelength free-electron laser beams.},

This technique uses phase-sensitive detection, with spectral scanning and simultaneous adjustment of the time delay between pump and probe pulses; it permits a direct measurement of spectra undistorted by chirp at all time scales, limited only by the resolution of the fs source. The method is applied to study the ultrafast relaxation dynamics of $\pi$-conjugated oligomers and semiconductor nanocrystals.},

Increasing the complexity of entangled states by expanding their dimensionality allows the implementation of novel fundamental tests of nature, and moreover also enables genuinely new protocols for quantum information processing. Here we present the creation of a (100$\times$100)-dimensional entangled quantum system, using spatial modes of photons. For its verification we develop a novel nonlinear criterion which infers entanglement dimensionality of a global state by using only information about its subspace correlations. This allows very practical experimental implementation as well as highly efficient extraction of entanglement dimensionality information. Applications in quantum cryptography and other protocols are very promising.},

Experimental study of the modal filtering of a temporally chirped beam from a Ti:Sapphire chirped-pulse-amplification system is presented. Beam profile, wavefront and pulse duration after compression were measured, showing a dramatic improvement of beam quality and no modifications of the temporal distribution. High-order harmonic generation in a rare gas, a highly nonlinear process which is phase-matching dependent, was used to test the effect of the filter and showed a clear enhancement of the generation.},

  Abstract                 = {A circularly polarized plane-wave is known to have no angular momentum when examined through Maxwell's equations. This, however, contradicts the experimentally observed facts, where finite segments of plane waves are known to be capable of imparting angular momentum to birefringent platelets. Using a superposition of four plane-waves propagating at slightly different angles to a common direction, we derive an expression for the angular momentum density of a single plane-wave in the limit when the propagation directions of the four beams come into alignment. We proceed to use this four-beam technique to analyze the conservation of angular momentum when a plane-wave enters a dielectric slab from the free space. The angular momentum of the beam is shown to decrease upon entering the dielectric medium, by virtue of the fact that the incident beam exerts a torque on the slab surface at the point of entry. When the beam leaves the slab, it imparts an equal but opposite torque to the exit facet, thus recovering its initial angular momentum upon re-emerging into the free-space. Along the way, we derive an expression for the outward-directed force of a normally incident, finite-diameter beam on a dielectric surface; the possible relationship between this force and the experimentally observed bulging of a liquid surface under intense illumination is explored.},

  Abstract                 = {A light beam can carry both spin angular momentum (SAM) and orbital angular momentum (OAM). SAM is commonly evidenced by circular dichroism (CD) experiments i. e. differential absorption of left and right-handed circularly polarized light. Recent experiments, supported by theoretical work, indicate that the corresponding effect with OAM instead of SAM is not observed in chiral matter. Isotropic materials can show CD when subjected to a magnetic field (MCD). We report a set of experiments, under well defined conditions, searching for magnetic orbital dichroism (MOD), differential absorption of light as a function of the sign of its OAM. We experimentally demonstrate that this effect, if any, is smaller than a few 10\&\#x02212;4 of MCD for the Nd:YAG 4I9/2 \&\#x02192; 4F5/2 transition. This transition is essentially of electric dipole nature. We give an intuitive argument suggesting that the lowest order of light matter interaction leading to MOD is the electric quadrupole term.},

Analysis is performed based on the first-order perturbation theory and the non-relativistic SchrÃ¶dinger equation. Special attention is paid to the dependence of the electron emission pattern on the impact parameter b of the ion with respect to the centre of the twisted wave front. In order to explore such a dependence, detailed calculations were carried out for the photoionization of the 1s ground and 2p y excited states of neutral hydrogen atoms. Based on these calculations, we argue that for relatively small impact parameters, the electron angular distributions may be strongly affected by altering the position of the atom within the wave front. In contrast, if the atom is placed far from the front centre, the emission pattern of the electrons is independent of the impact parameter b and resembles that observed in the photoionization by plane wave photons.},

In the present work, we address one of these processes: radiative recombination of twisted electrons with bare ions. On the basis of the density matrix formalism and the non-relativistic SchrÃ¶dinger theory, analytical expressions are derived for the angular distribution and the linear polarization of photons emitted due to the capture of twisted electrons into the ground state of (hydrogen-like) ions. We show that these angular and polarization distributions are sensitive to both the transverse momentum and the topological charge of the electron beam. To observe in particular the value of this charge, we propose an experiment that makes use of the coherent superposition of two twisted beams.},

By solving the Laguerre\&\#x2013;Gauss differential equation in the asymptotic limit of a large radial index, we find the parameters to perform a peer comparison, showing that LGBs can propagate quasi-nondiffracting beams within the same region of space where the corresponding BBs do. We also demonstrate that LGBs, which have the property of self-healing, are more robust in the sense that they can propagate further than BBs under similar initial conditions.},

This theory is applied, using Green function calculations within the finite-difference time-domain method, to calculate spatially resolved vortex-EELS maps of a metal split ring resonator (SRR). The vortex-EELS scattering cross section for the SRR structure is within an order of magnitude of conventional EELS typically for metal nanoparticles. This is promising in terms of feasibility for future measurements to map out the local magnetic response of metal nanostructures and to characterize their magnetic plasmon response in applications, including metamaterials.},

  Abstract                 = {Pheromones play important roles in chemical communication among organisms. Various chiral and non-racemic pheromones have been identified since the late 1960s. Their enantioselective syntheses could establish the absolute configuration of the naturally occurring pheromones and clarified the relationships between absolute configuration and bioactivity. For example, neither the (R)- nor (S)-enantiomer of sulcatol, the aggregation pheromone of an ambrosia beetle Gnathotrichus sulcatus, is behaviorally active, while their mixture is bioactive. In the case of olean, the olive fruit fly pheromone, its (R)-isomer is active for the males, and the (S)-isomer is active for the females. About 140 chiral pheromones are reviewed with regard to their stereochemistryâ€“bioactivity relationships. Problems encountered in studying chirality of pheromones were examined and analyzed to think about possible future directions in pheromone science. },

  Abstract                 = {SU5 is a high-resolution variable-polarization synchrotron radiation (SR) beam line with which linear and circular dichroism experiments are performed in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) range (5--40 eV), based on an electromagnetic crossed undulator called the Onduleur Plan/Helico\"{i}dal du Lure \`{a} Induction Electromagn\'{e}tique (OPHELIE). To get precise knowledge of the polarization state of the emitted SR and to take into account the polarization transformations induced by reflection on the various optics, we set up an in situ VUV polarimeter to provide a precise and complete polarization analysis of the SR at the sample location. The overall measured polarization performances were highly satisfactory, with measured linear polarization rates of more than 98\% (83\%) in the vertical (horizontal) linear polarization mode and an average 92.1\% (95.2\%) circular polarization rate for the right- (left)-handed circular polarization mode, which, to our knowledge, are the highest reported values in the VUV range. Despite some uneven photon energy efficiency, the OPHELIE crossed undulator behaves as expected in terms of polarization, permitting full control of the emitted polarization by manipulation of the vertical-to-horizontal magnetic field ratio ($\rho$und) and the relative longitudinal phase ($\phi$und).},

  Abstract                 = {Photoelectron circular dichroism (PECD) manifests itself as an intense forward/backward asymmetry in the angular distribution of photoelectrons produced from randomly-oriented enantiomers by photoionization with circularly-polarized light (CPL). As a sensitive probe of both photoionization dynamics and of the chiral molecular potential{,} PECD attracts much interest especially with the recent performance of related experiments with visible and VUV laser sources. Here we report{,} by use of quasi-perfect CPL VUV synchrotron radiation and using a double imaging photoelectron/photoion coincidence (i2PEPICO) spectrometer{,} new and very accurate values of the corresponding asymmetries on showcase chiral isomers: camphor and fenchone. These data have additionally been normalized to the absolute enantiopurity of the sample as measured by a chromatographic technique. They can therefore be used as benchmarking data for new PECD experiments{,} as well as for theoretical models. In particular we found{,} especially for the outermost orbital of both molecules{,} a good agreement with CMS-X[small alpha] PECD modeling over the whole VUV range. We also report a spectacular sensitivity of PECD to isomerism for slow electrons{,} showing large and opposite asymmetries when comparing R-camphor to R-fenchone (respectively -10% and +16% around 10 eV). In the course of this study{,} we could also assess the analytical potential of PECD. Indeed{,} the accuracy of the data we provide are such that limited departure from perfect enantiopurity in the sample we purchased could be detected and estimated in excellent agreement with the analysis performed in parallel via a chromatographic technique{,} establishing a new standard of accuracy{,} in the +/-1% range{,} for enantiomeric excess measurement via PECD. The i2PEPICO technique allows correlating PECD measurements to specific parent ion masses{,} which would allow its application to analysis of complex mixtures.},

Both spin and orbital angular momentum can be transferred from a light beam to particles held within optical tweezers, so forming an optical spanner. Each also give rise to a frequency shift when the light beam is rotated. This arises because quarter or half-wave plates and $\pi$/2 or $\pi$ mode converters play equivalent roles for spin and orbital angular momentum respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {The conical diffraction mounting in which the direction of incident light belongs to a plane parallel to the direction of the grooves has the unique property of maintaining high diffraction efficiency, even in the extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) region. This property is useful for designing high-throughput time-delay-compensated monochromators for the spectral selection of ultrashort EUV pulses as the high-order harmonics generated by the interaction between an ultrashort laser pulse and a gas jet. The time compensation allows one to exploit the femtosecond scale duration of the harmonics both to have high intensity and to reach an unprecedented temporal resolution for pump and probe experiments. Because two gratings have to be used for time compensation, the high diffraction efficiency becomes an essential requirement, which can be fulfilled by the conical diffraction mounting. Measurements recently accomplished at the Bending Magnet for Emission Absorption and Reflectivity (BEAR) beam line (ELETTRA Synchrotron, Trieste, Italy) for three gratings in the10-90 nm region are reported here that show a peak efficiency of as much as 0.7 in the first order. A model computing the electromagnetic propagation and the grating efficiency, implemented and tested with the experimental data, permits the study and design of rather complex systems operating in the conical mounting. Basic physical principles and mathematical aspects of the model are discussed here.},

In all cases, so far, photons were assumed to carry one unit of angular momentum. However it is now clear that photons can possess extra angular momentum, the orbital angular momentum (OAM), related to their spatial profile. We show a complete description of photoionization by OAM photons, including new selection rules involving more than one unit of angular momentum. We explore theoretically the interaction of a single electron atom located at the center of an intense ultraviolet beam bearing OAM, envisaging new scenarios for quantum optics.},

  Abstract                 = {Bijvoetâ€™s method, which makes use of anomalous x-ray diffraction or dispersion, is the standard means of directly determining the absolute (stereochemical) configuration of molecules, but it requires crystalline samples and often proves challenging in structures exclusively comprising light atoms. Herein, we demonstrate a mass spectrometry approach that directly images the absolute configuration of individual molecules in the gas phase by cold target recoil ion momentum spectroscopy after laser ionizationâ€“induced Coulomb explosion. This technique is applied to the prototypical chiral molecule bromochlorofluoromethane and the isotopically chiral methane derivative bromodichloromethane.},

The difference of the response of the chiral molecule to circularly polarized light with opposite handedness was found to be less than 0.2% for the total ion yield and less than 0.5% for the partial ion yield. Additionally we tried to find a dipole allowed molecular orientation CD effect by analysing the fragmentation in the forward and backward direction. For this effect we found an upper limit of 1â€“2% for all abundant ionic fragments.},

  Abstract                 = {Tang and Cohen \[Phys. Rev. Lett.104, 163901 (2010)\] recently demonstrated a scheme to enhance the chiral response of molecules, which relies on the use of circularly polarized light in a standing wave configuration. Here we show a new type of light that possesses orbital angular momentum and enhanced chiral response. In the locations where the beams show enhanced optical chirality, only the longitudinal components of the electric and magnetic fields survive, which has unexpectedly shown what we believe is a new way to yield an enhanced optical chiral response.},

  Abstract                 = {Phase sensitive soft-x-ray microscopy methods enable the study of specimens for which phase effects are a prevalent contrast mechanism. One way to detect these phase effects is to optically implement the radial Hilbert transform by using spiral zone plates (SZPs), which results in the isotropic measurement of the amplitude and phase gradient in a sample. Soft-x-ray microscopy using an SZP as a single element objective lens was demonstrated through the imaging of a 1 $\mu$m circular aperture at a wavelength of 2.73 nm(454 eV). A regular zone plate, a charge 1 SZP, and a charge 2 SZP were fabricated using electron beam lithography and were used as the imaging optic in the microscopy setup. The charge 1 and charge 2 SZP images exhibited isotropic edge enhancement as a result of radial Hilbert filtering.},

  Abstract                 = {We report on the coherent dynamics of the photoexcited orbital angular momentum (OAM) states of GaN excitons. The measurements were performed by a pump-probe four-wave mixing (FWM) using optical vortex (OV) pulses, where the pump OV pulse transfers its OAM to the center of mass momentum of excitons and the conversion of OAM via FWM with the probe pulse is detected. Especially, we performed analysis of the signal using an OAM-resolved spectroscopy, which allows us to evaluate the dephasing dynamics of excitons in time and space. The results indicate that near perfect conversion is achieved using the OV pulses with nonzero OAM and its spatial coherence remains high during the dephasing time, clearly indicating that the excitons keep the OAM transferred by the pump OV. In contrast, the component associated with the imperfect conversion becomes significant when one of the incident pulses intentionally includes an OAM-free component. The effect is clearly confirmed by the FWM excited by the pump with multiple OAM.},

Calibrated EUV-CD spectra of L-alanine exhibited a large negative peak at around 120 nm and a positive CD signal below 90 nm, which were roughly predicted by theoretical calculations. A CD measurement system with an Onuki-type polarizing undulator was used to obtain the EUV-CD spectra. This CD system, the development of which took five years, can be used to observe even weak natural CD spectra. The polarization characteristics of this system were also evaluated in order to calibrate the recorded CD spectra.

  Abstract                 = { Gas-phase pure enantiomers of alanine, the simplest proteinaceous chiral amino acid, are investigated by photoelectron circular dichroism, a direct chiroptical, orbital-sensitive effect giving rise to large asymmetries in the photoelectron angular distribution upon photoionization by circularly polarized light. Here we report electron imaging measurements made at the Lyman-alpha radiation photon energy (10.2 eV) that reveal a strong overall asymmetry for the outermost orbital. Despite the anticipated presence of different conformers, this asymmetry is effectively independent of sample temperature (and hence of conformer population). Furthermore, because of the associated recoiling of the corresponding ion, photoionization by circularly polarized light can generate an asymmetric flux of gas-phase alanine cations, allowing us to deduce an enantiomeric excess, in a given line of sight, of up to 4%. In addition to the implications for the origin of biomolecular asymmetry, these studies pave the way for future chiroptical analytical studies of more complex biomolecules such as peptides. },

  Abstract                 = {Applications of x-ray magnetic circular and linear dichroism (XMCD and XMLD) are reviewed in the soft x-ray region, covering the photon energy range 0.4-2 keV, which includes important absorption edges such as the 3 d transition metal L 2,3 and rare earth M 4,5 . These techniques enable a broad range of novel and exciting studies such as on the electronic properties and magnetic ordering of novel nanostructured systems. XMCD has a sensitivity better than 0.01 monolayer (at the surface) and due to simple detection methods, such as electron yield and fluorescence yield, it has become a workhorse technique in physics and materials science. It is the only element-specific technique able to distinguish between the spin and orbital parts of the magnetic moments. The applications are vast, e.g., in x-ray holographic imaging, XMCD gives a spatial resolution of tens of nm. While many studies in the past were centered on physics, more recently new applications have emerged in areas such as chemistry, biology and earth and environmental sciences. For instance, XMCD allows the determination of the cation occupations in spinels and other ternary oxides. In scanning transmission x-ray microscopy (STXM), XMCD enables us to map biogenic magnetite redox changes resulting in a surprising degree of variation on the nanoscale. Another recent development is ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) detected by time-resolved XMCD which opens the door to element-, site- and layer-specific dynamical measurements. By exploiting the time structure of the pulsed synchrotron radiation from the storage ring the relative phase of precession in the individual magnetic layers of a multilayer stack can be determined.},

To circularly polarize the initially linearly polarized harmonics we have implemented a four-reflector phase-shifter. Fully circularly polarized radiation has been obtained with an efficiency of a few percents, thus being significantly more efficient than currently demonstrated direct generation of elliptically polarized harmonics. This demonstration opens up new experimental capabilities based on high order harmonics, for example, in biology and materials science. The inherent femtosecond time resolution of high order harmonic generating table top laser sources renders these an ideal tool for the investigation of ultrafast magnetization dynamics now that the magnetic circular dichroism at the absorption M-edges of transition metals can be exploited.},

  Abstract                 = {As they travel through space, some light beams rotate. Such light beams have angular momentum. There are two particularly important ways in which a light beam can rotate: if every polarization vector rotates, the light has spin; if the phase structure rotates, the light has orbital angular momentum (OAM), which can be many times greater than the spin. Only in the past 20Â years has it been realized that beams carrying OAM, which have an optical vortex along the axis, can be easily made in the laboratory. These light beams are able to spin microscopic objects, give rise to rotational frequency shifts, create new forms of imaging systems, and behave within nonlinear material to give new insights into quantum optics.},

  Abstract                 = {We present a dynamic interferometry to measure the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of beams. An opaque screen with two nonparallel air slits is employed that can be regarded as the Young\&\#x2019;s double-pinhole interference. When the OAM beams with an annular intensity distribution vertically incident, the far-field interference patterns depend on the phase difference of the light in the two pinholes. We scan the angle between the two slits, and the output intensity at center changes alternatively between darkness and brightness. Utilizing this characteristic, we can measure the OAM of light. This scheme is very simple and low-cost. In addition, it can measure very large topological charge of OAM beams due to continuous scanning.},
